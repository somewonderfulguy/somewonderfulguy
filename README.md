#### React state management

The most recent and relevant experience is working with React Query for several years as a server state solution. \
And Zustand or React Context for client state managament. \
I also have experience of working with Redux and MobX for couple years with each of it.

### Scalability

I have experience of working with monorepo and turning SPA into a monorepo.\
As for monorepo solutions my experience is using: npm/yarn/pnpm packages and Nx.\
Also, played around with Turborepo.

Module Federation is another topic that related to scalability I've been studying and read a [book](https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation) about it.\
However, haven't used this solution in real projects yet.
